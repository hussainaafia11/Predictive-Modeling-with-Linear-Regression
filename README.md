# Predictive-Modeling-with-Linear-Regression
This project showcases a simple Linear Regression model to predict weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall based on historical weather data. The model is built using Python and the scikit-learn library.

Features
-Load and explore weather dataset
-Visualize weather patterns (scatter plots, heatmaps)
-Split data into training and testing sets
-Build and train a Linear Regression model
-Predict and evaluate performance (RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE)
-Plot regression line and residuals
